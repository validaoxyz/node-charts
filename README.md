# node-charts
A python script that, given a csv file with node location data, such as generated by [this](https://github.com/validaoxyz/node-maps) will generate bar and pie charts for top N ISPs and countries of a node distribution list.

Expects input in the format of:
```
country,city,lat,long,ASN,ISP,moniker,version
```

To run:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 <input-file.csv>
```

The script will then output a pie chart and bar chart for the top N countries, ISPs, and client versions
